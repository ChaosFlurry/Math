	//In general, the behavior of a linear system is determined by the relationship between the number of equations and the number of unknowns:
	//Usually, a system with fewer equations than unknowns has infinitely many solutions, but it may have no solution. Such a system is known as an underdetermined system.
	//Usually, a system with the same number of equations and unknowns has a single unique solution.
	//Usually, a system with more equations than unknowns has no solution. Such a system is also known as an overdetermined system.
	//In the first case, the dimension of the solution set is usually equal to n âˆ’ m, where n is the number of variables and m is the number of equations.
